        it will turn into the same color as the word in the menu. If the label you think is most appropriate for the stroke is not already \
        in the menu, please click other to provide your own label. If you change your mind about a stroke you already labeled, just click\
         that stroke again, and select a new label from the menu. Repeat steps 1â€“4 until you have labeled all the strokes in the sketch\
